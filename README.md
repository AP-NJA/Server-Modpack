# Server-Modpack
Modpack that I use with my friends on a server.

If you want to enable a mod, look for the mod that has the file format "disabled" and remove it. From there, the mod will be active, so boot up Minecraft and it should work. If you have a launcher like Prism Launcher,
then just enable it in the mods menu.
